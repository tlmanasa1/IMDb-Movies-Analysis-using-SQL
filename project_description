Project Explanation: IMDB Movie Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze a movie database using SQL to gain insights into various aspects of movies, such as trends, production statistics, ratings, crew analysis, and more. Below is a detailed explanation of each segment:

________________________________

Segment 1: Data Quality Check and Basic Insights

Objective: Ensure data integrity and identify missing values.

Find Total Rows in the Movies Table: We first determine the total number of rows in the movies table to understand the scale of the dataset.

sql
Copy code
select count(*) from movies;  -- 7997 rows

Identify Columns with Null Values: We check for missing values in critical columns like country and languages.

sql
Copy code
select
sum(case when country is null then 1 else 0 end) as country_nulls,
sum(case when languages is null then 1 else 0 end) as languages_nulls
from movies;

Segment 2: Movie Release Trends

Objective: Analyze the trends in movie releases over the years and months.

Total Number of Movies Released Each Year and Month: We group the data by year and month to understand the movie release trend.

sql
Copy code
select year, substr(date_published, 4, 2) as month, count(id) as movies_released
from movies
group by year, substr(date_published, 4, 2)
order by year, substr(date_published, 4, 2);

Movies Produced in the USA or India in 2019: We focus on movies produced in India or the USA in 2019.

sql
Copy code
select count(id) as movies_released
from movies
where (country = 'India' or country = 'USA') and year = 2019;

Segment 3: Production Statistics and Genre Analysis

Objective: Analyze the production statistics of movies, focusing on genres and their characteristics.

Retrieve Unique Genres: We list all the distinct genres in the dataset.

sql
Copy code
select distinct genre from movies
left join genre on (movies.id = genre.movie_id);

Identify Genre with the Highest Number of Movies: We determine which genre has the most movies produced.

sql
Copy code
select genre, count(movie_id) as movies
from movies
left join genre on (movies.id = genre.movie_id)
group by genre
order by 2 desc;

Movies Belonging to Only One Genre: We count movies that are associated with only one genre.

sql
Copy code
with cte as (
    select id, count(distinct genre) as genres
    from movies
    left join genre on (movies.id = genre.movie_id)
    group by id
    having count(distinct genre) = 1
)
select count(id) as movies from cte;

Average Movie Duration by Genre: We calculate the average duration of movies for each genre.

Rank of 'Thriller' Genre by Movie Count: We rank genres based on the number of movies produced, specifically for the 'Thriller' genre.

sql
Copy code
with cte as (
    select genre, count(movie_id) as movies
    from movies
    left join genre on (movies.id = genre.movie_id)
    group by genre
    order by 2 desc
)
select *, rank() over (order by movies desc) as genre_rank
from cte;

Segment 4: Ratings Analysis and Crew Members

Objective: Analyze movie ratings and crew contributions.

Min/Max Ratings: Retrieve the minimum and maximum average ratings.

sql
Copy code
select max(avg_rating) as max_avg_rating, min(avg_rating) as min_avg_rating
from ratings;

Top 10 Movies Based on Average Rating: We fetch the top 10 movies with the highest average ratings.

sql
Copy code
select movie_id
from ratings
order by avg_rating desc
limit 10;

Production House with Most Hit Movies: We identify the production house with the most movies rated above 8.

sql
Copy code
select production_company, count(id) as movies
from movies
left join ratings on (movies.id = ratings.movie_id)
where avg_rating > 8
group by production_company
order by movies desc;

Movies Released in March 2017 in the USA with >1000 Votes: We analyze genre-specific trends for movies in March 2017 with more than 1000 votes.

________________________________

Segment 5: Crew Analysis

Objective: Analyze crew members' contribution to movies, especially directors and actors.

Top Three Directors in Top Genres: We focus on the directors with the most successful movies in the top three genres.

sql
Copy code
with cte as (
    select genre, name_id as director_id, count(id) as movies
    from movies
    left join genre on (movies.id = genre.movie_id)
    left join director_mapping on (movies.id = director_mapping.movie_id)
    group by name_id, genre
    order by genre, movies desc
),
cte2 as (
    select *, row_number() over(partition by genre order by movies desc) as rank
    from cte
    where director_id is not null
),
cte3 as (
    select genre, count(id) as movies
    from movies
    left join genre on (movies.id = genre.movie_id)
    group by genre
    order by movies desc
    limit 3
)
select director_id, name, genre
from cte2
left join names on (cte2.director_id = names.id)
where rank <= 3 and genre in (select genre from cte3)
order by genre;

Top Actors Based on Median Ratings: We identify the top two actors based on the median rating of their movies.

Segment 6: Broader Understanding of Data

Objective: Dive deeper into broader movie insights, including genre classification, trends, and performance metrics.

Classify Thriller Movies Based on Average Ratings: We categorize thriller movies into 'Hit', 'Flop', or 'Avg' based on their average ratings.

sql
Copy code
select id, avg_rating,
case when avg_rating > 8 then 'Hit Movie'
     when avg_rating < 5 then 'Flop Movie'
     else 'Avg Movie' end as Movie_category
from movies m
left join genre g on (m.id = g.movie_id)
left join ratings r on (m.id = r.movie_id)
where genre = 'Thriller';

Genre-wise Running Total and Moving Average of Movie Durations: We calculate the running total and moving average of movie durations for each genre.

Top Grossing Movies by Genre: We identify the top grossing movies for each year within the top three genres.

Production Houses with Highest Number of Hits in Multilingual Movies: We analyze production houses based on the number of hits (movies with ratings > 8) in multilingual movies.

Top Actresses in Drama Movies: We identify the top actresses with the most hit drama movies.
